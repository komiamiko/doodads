"""
Small library for working with very pure functional systems,
especially within the lambda calculus.

Important usage notes:
- The lambda calculus is Turing complete and capable of arbitrary
  computation, including non-halting programs and wasting all your
  computing resources. If this is being used seriously instead of
  as a playground ie. on a server, ensure you have strict safeguards.
- Lazy evaluation is used for all the lambda objects.
  This behaviour is hidden to the typical user, however, if you are
  diving deeper and working with the lambda objects, know that
  most computation is deferred until you call .evaluate_now()
- The De Bruijn indexed form is the canonical form here.
  It is a useful normal form. Under the current implementation,
  it will always evaluate correctly, unlike the named form,
  where name collisions may sometimes cause functions to behave
  in unexpected ways. For this reason, we strictly forbid
  directly evaluating the named form.
- String forms of lambda expressions are LaTeX-compatible
  (outputs from str) and LaTeX-like (input to parse_lambda).
  Outputs of str will generally reconstruct the object
  exactly when parsed, though strange variable names
  may interfere with the parsing logic and cause
  a different object to be constructed.
- Renaming an indexed variable as it passes between scopes
  is referred to here as "promotion". It's not standard
  mathematical vocabulary, but giving it a name helps communication.

    It may be confusing why named bindings
    use a ChainMap instead of a regular dict.
    Simply put, we cannot guarantee variable names are unique.

    Hash values are kept as part of the state and updated along with the
    update operations. This way, the hash operation can be O(1),
